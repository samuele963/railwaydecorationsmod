# Railway Decorations mod

## About this mod
This is a Minecraft mod dedicated to adding decorative blocks, such as signs, for building railway stations.

## Current and planned features
At the moment, the mod only includes signage blocks, for example platform, zone and exit signs and no entry signs,
as well as a "railway crafting item" used for crafting these blocks in Survival mode.

In the future, I plan to add platform edge blocks and blocks for decorating the inside of stations (such as ticket machines), as well as some randomly generated structures such as abandoned train depots.
